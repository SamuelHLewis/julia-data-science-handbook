    "# Packages\n",
    "As of July 2022, Julia has almost 8,000 packages that can be loaded to provide additional functionality. These can be found in a couple of places:\n",
    "* the [Julia Registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) is the default package registry, and holds the files that are downloaded when you run the package installer from the Julia REPL\n",
    "* the [Julia Packages site](https://juliapackages.com/) provides a more user-friendly interface to the Julia Registry. It has options to search on package name, see all packages written by a specific developer, and sort all packages by date of release or update. I also tracks which packages are trending\n",
    "* the [JuliaHub Packages page](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) also allows searching of the Julia Registry, and gives options to search packages by license type as well as name. It also has tags to collect packages by topic e.g. `machine-learning` or `Bayesian-statistics`"

A few useful commands are:\n",

For more information on environments and package management, see the [Pkg.jl docs](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) and the [Julia docs on environments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Environments-1)."
